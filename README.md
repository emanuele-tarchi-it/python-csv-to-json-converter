A professional desktop application designed to bridge the gap between spreadsheet data (CSV) and web-ready formats (JSON) with a user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **User-Friendly GUI:** No more editing code! Select files and save locations using standard system dialogs.
- **Smart Conversion:** Powered by Pandas for high-speed processing of large datasets.
- **Web Ready:** Exports in UTF-8 encoding to ensure international characters are preserved.
- **Error Handling:** Built-in validation to prevent crashes during the conversion process.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
The application requires the Pandas library for data processing:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

🛠 How to Use
1. Run the Application: Execute the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```
2. Select Source: Click the "Sfoglia e Converti" button to pick your CSV file.

3. Choose Destination: Specify where you want to save your new JSON file.

4. Instant Feedback: A success message will confirm the number of records converted.

## 💡 Pro Tip: Clean before you Convert
For the best results, especially with messy datasets, I recommend running your files through my Python CSV Data Cleaner first. 
This ensures all empty rows and hidden spaces are removed before the JSON conversion.
