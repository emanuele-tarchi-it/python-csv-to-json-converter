A specialized tool for developers and data analysts to bridge the gap between spreadsheet data (CSV) and web-ready formats (JSON).

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Column Selection:** Choose only the data you need for your JSON output.
- **Custom Formatting:** Control JSON indentation for better readability.
- **Web Ready:** Exports in UTF-8 encoding to support international characters.
- **High Performance:** Powered by Pandas for fast processing of large files.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
Install the required library:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

🛠 How to Use
Place your CSV file in the project folder.

Edit csv_to_json.py to set your desired input_file and columns.

Run the script:
```bash
python csv_to_json.py
```
## 💡 Pro Tip: Clean before you Convert
For the best results, especially with messy datasets, I recommend running your files through my Python CSV Data Cleaner first. 
This ensures all empty rows and hidden spaces are removed before the JSON conversion.
